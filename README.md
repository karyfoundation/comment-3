# Comment

What can I say? I love my style of code commenting. (Checkout [this](https://github.com/pmkary/Comment/blob/master/Comment/MainWindowController.swift) as an example). My style is so much clear, well sectioned and beautiful. However in a code of my style something like 68% of the LoC is `comment` + `whitespace`. You'll need a good comment generator. So... Here is the one! It supports all the possible KaryStyle comments and settings for all languages.
